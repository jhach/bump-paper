Hola!

My name is Jalen Wu and I was a former pro wrestler in Southern California from 2009-2011. 

I started my career by reaching out to Bryan Alvarez: a podcaster, editor, and publisher of the [Figure Four Weekly](https://www.f4wonline.com) to learn more about wrestling schools in Seattle, Washington, where I lived at the time. He referred me to "Playboy" Buddy Rose's and Colonel DeBeers' school located in Portland, Oregon. I made the two hour drive on Sundays to the [Straight Blast Gym](https://www.straightblastgym.com) where they had a ring and mma/workout equipment located near the Rose Garden.


I then moved to Long Beach, California to train and perform with AWS (Alternative Wrestling Show) based in the City of Industry. If you know SoCal, you're aware that I endured miserable hours in traffic on the 405/10/60 at 2pm on a weekday to catch a 4pm class. Other than performing for AWS I performed for NWPW (New Wave Pro Wrestling), where I was a tag team champion, IWL (Insane Wrestling League), and multiple indy lucha promotions around Los Angeles.

I created this project to share my experience and hope it helps others to succeed as a pro wrestler / sports entertainer. I'm data-driven and guarantee you'll consume a lot of stats to help grow and maximize your career.
