# All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW): The Epicenter of Strong Style

When you talk about Japanese wrestling, it’s impossible not to mention All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). Founded by the legendary Giant Baba in 1972, AJPW became the heartbeat of strong style wrestling, a place where physicality met pure storytelling, and where some of the greatest matches of all time were born. This is the promotion that brought you the Four Pillars of Heaven: Mitsuharu Misawa, Kenta Kobashi, Toshiaki Kawada, and Akira Taue. They redefined what it meant to be a professional wrestler in the 1990s.

## The Legacy of Giant Baba

Giant Baba wasn't just a founder, he was the soul of AJPW. His vision for professional wrestling was one of respect, honor, and brutal competition. He set the stage for a promotion that would become synonymous with some of the toughest, most technical wrestling on the planet. Matches in AJPW weren’t just about who won or lost, they were about who could endure, who could push their body to the absolute limit, and who could tell the most compelling story inside the ropes.

### The Four Pillars of Heaven: Wrestling Icons

Any discussion of AJPW's legacy must include the Four Pillars of Heaven. These four men: Misawa, Kobashi, Kawada, and Taue took wrestling to an art form. Their battles in the 1990s are the stuff of legend, with matches that routinely went over 30 minutes (imagine the lines to the bathroom), each filled with dramatic near falls, hard hitting strikes, and enough emotion to fill an arena ten times over.

### Must Watch Matches: AJPW's Greatest Hits

If you’re new to AJPW or just looking to revisit some classics, here’s a quick list of must-watch matches:

1. **Mitsuharu Misawa vs. Toshiaki Kawada (June 3, 1994)** - Often regarded as one of the greatest matches of all time, this bout encapsulated everything that made AJPW special. MQI coming soon.
   
2. **Kenta Kobashi vs. Stan Hansen (July 29, 1993)** - A brutal display of strong style, where every chop and lariat felt like it could end a career. MQI coming soon.
   
3. **Giant Baba & Jumbo Tsuruta vs. The Funks (December 3, 1977)** - A classic tag team match that showcased the early days of AJPW’s global reach. MQI coming soon.

### AJPW's Influence on Modern Wrestling

AJPW’s influence isn’t just confined to Japan; it’s global. Promotions around the world have borrowed from the AJPW playbook, incorporating elements of strong style and the long-form storytelling that made AJPW’s matches legendary. Many of today’s top stars grew up watching AJPW tapes, and you can see that influence in how they work in the ring today.

## The Modern Era of AJPW

While the heyday of the Four Pillars has passed, AJPW continues to be a significant player in the wrestling world. The promotion has adapted to modern tastes while still maintaining the core of what made it special. Wrestlers like **Kento Miyahara** and **Suwama** have carried the torch, ensuring that the legacy of AJPW remains strong.

## Why AJPW Still Matters

In a world where wrestling is constantly evolving, AJPW stands as a monument to what professional wrestling can be when it’s at its best. It’s a reminder that wrestling is as much about storytelling and emotion as it is about athleticism and technique. Whether you’re a longtime fan or someone just discovering Japanese wrestling, AJPW offers something timeless and essential.
