description: "WWE NXT Vengeance Day 2023 was a night of action, drama, and surprises. The event featured six matches, each with its own story and stakes. But which matches were worth watching, and which ones were better off skipped? And how did they rank according to the **Match Quality Index (MQI)**, a metric that combines the match ratings, the match length, and WON rating?"

## The Good

### WWE NXT North American Title Match: Wes Lee (c) vs. Dijak

**MQI Score: 8.464**

This was the match of the night, hands down. Wes Lee and Dijak put on a clinic of athleticism, power, and agility. The two men traded high-flying moves, hard-hitting strikes, and near-falls that kept the fans on the edge of their seats. Lee retained his title after hitting a 450 splash from the top rope, but Dijak earned his respect and the crowd's admiration. This was a classic NXT match that showcased the best of the brand.

### Best Two Out Of Three Falls Match: Carmelo Hayes (w/Trick Williams) vs. Apollo Crews

**MQI Score: 8.296**

This was a close second to the North American title match, and another example of NXT's excellence. Carmelo Hayes and Apollo Crews had a personal feud that stemmed from Crews' return to NXT and his attack on Hayes. The two men had a heated and competitive match that went the distance. Hayes won the first fall with a roll-up, Crews won the second fall with a powerbomb, and Hayes won the third and final fall with a superkick. Hayes proved that he is a rising star in NXT, while Crews showed that he still has a lot to offer.

## The Bad

### WWE NXT Women's Tag Team Title Match: Fallon Henley & Kiana James (w/Brooks Jensen & Josh Briggs) vs. Katana Chance & Kayden Carter (c)

**MQI Score: 4.896**

This was the weakest match of the night, and one that could have been skipped. The match was short, sloppy, and predictable. Fallon Henley and Kiana James, the newcomers who aligned themselves with Brooks Jensen and Josh Briggs, challenged the champions Katana Chance and Kayden Carter, who have been a solid team for a while. The challengers dominated most of the match, but the champions retained after a miscommunication between Henley and James. The match did nothing to elevate the women's tag team division, and felt like filler.

### WWE NXT Title Steel Cage Match: Bron Breakker (c) vs. Grayson Waller

**MQI Score: 6.068**

This was the main event of the night, but it was also a disappointment. Bron Breakker and Grayson Waller had a heated rivalry that culminated in a steel cage match for the NXT title. The match had some decent spots, such as Waller's moonsault from the top of the cage, and Breakker's powerslam through the cage door. But the match also lacked intensity, drama, and suspense. Breakker retained his title after escaping the cage, but the fans were not invested in the outcome. The match felt like a letdown after the previous matches.

The MQI scores for the matches at WWE NXT Vengeance Day 2023 are:

| Roxanne Perez (c) vs. Gigi Dolin and Jacy Jayne |           3 |           14 |               2 |              3 |     6.452 |
| Bron Breakker (c) vs. Grayson Waller          |        3.25 |           14 |               2 |              2 |     6.068 |

The average MQI score for the event was **6.903**, which is a decent score, but not a great one. The event had some high points, but also some low points. The event could have been better if the women's tag team title match and the NXT title steel cage match were more exciting and engaging.
