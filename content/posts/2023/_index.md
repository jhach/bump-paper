So here we are, looking back at 2023—the year wrestling decided to rewrite its own rulebook. Whether it was WWE finally pulling the trigger on that jaw dropping swerve, AEW continuing to play chess while everyone else played checkers, or NJPW quietly putting on the kind of matches that make you fall in love with wrestling all over again, 2023 was nothing short of a wild ride. And if you’re the type who craves deep dives, smart analysis, and a little bit of attitude with your wrestling takes, you’ve come to the right place. Welcome to bumpXfeed’s roundup of the year that was.

## The Year WWE Grew Some Edges

Let’s not sugarcoat it, 2023 was a year of reckoning for WWE. They took some big swings, and whether you loved or hated it, you can’t say they played it safe. From shock returns to title runs that nobody saw coming, WWE was all about keeping you on your toes. If you blinked, you missed something major. Lucky for you, we didn’t. We’ve got the breakdowns, the blow-by-blow recaps, and of course, the scorching hot takes you’ve come to expect.

## AEW: Still the Cool Kid on the Block

If WWE was the big budget blockbuster, AEW was the other promotion that everyone couldn’t stop talking about. They didn’t just ride the wave, they made the wave. This year saw the emergence of new stars, match of the year candidates every other week, and booking that made you nod your head in approval. With bumpXfeed in your corner, you won’t just get what happened, you’ll get why it mattered and what it means for the future.

## NJPW and the Global Wrestling Scene

Meanwhile, on the other side of the world, NJPW quietly (and not-so-quietly) reminded everyone why they’re still a force to be reckoned with. 2023 saw them deliver some absolute classics that will be talked about for years to come. And don’t even get us started on the cross-promotion fireworks that lit up the wrestling world. Stick with us as we dissect every suplex, every near-fall, and every “Holy Shit!” moment that kept the global wrestling scene red-hot this year.
