Austin Theory defeated his childhood hero, WWE legend John Cena, by pinfall at Wrestlemania 39 in Los Angeles, California. While some may argue that his success has been quick, he's actually been wrestling matches since 2016. The 25 year old has 7 years of experience in the wrestling business, not including his training. 

He began his wrestling career at a young age and trained at the World Wrestling Alliance 4 (WWA4) wrestling school in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2016, Theory made his debut in the wrestling promotion Evolve, where he gained attention for his impressive athleticism and charisma. He quickly rose through the ranks and became one of the top prospects in the independent wrestling scene. Theory also competed in other prominent wrestling promotions such as Full Impact Pro (FIP), World Wrestling Network, and Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG).

In 2019, Theory signed with WWE and joined the NXT brand, which is WWE's developmental territory. He made his NXT debut in September of 2019, wrestling at NXT house shows, and gained recognition for his in-ring skills and confident persona. Theory had notable matches against established NXT stars and was praised for his potential as a future star in WWE.

In 2020, Theory was promoted to the main roster for WWE's RAW in March where he tagged with Angel Garza & Seth Rollins losing to Kevin Owens & The Street Profits. He would remain on RAW until June 2020 when WWE sent him back to NXT for additional training. He became a member of the wrestling stable "The Way" on WWE's weekly television show, NXT. Remained on NXT til July 2021
