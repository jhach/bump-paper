# WWE Crown Jewel 2023: The Best and Worst Matches to Watch

## What is the Match Quality Index (MQI)?
The Match Quality Index (MQI) is a metric that combines the match rating and the match length to give a more comprehensive score for each match. The match rating is a subjective measure of the quality of the match, based on the ratings from [cagematch.net](https://www.cagematch.net/?id=1&nr=370470), a website that provides ratings and match length for wrestling matches. The match length is the duration of the match in minutes, as reported by the same website.

The MQI is calculated as follows:

```
MQI = (Match Rating * 10) + Match Length
```

This formula gives more weight to the match rating, as it is a more subjective measure of the quality of the match. However, it also takes into account the length of the match, as longer matches are generally more physically demanding and require more endurance from the wrestlers.

The MQI ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better matches.

## The Best Matches to Watch

Based on the MQI, here are the matches you should watch from WWE Crown Jewel 2023:

### WWE World Heavyweight Title Match: Seth Rollins vs. Drew McIntyre (97.64)

This match was the highest-rated match of the night, and for good reason. It was a hard-hitting, back-and-forth affair that kept the crowd on its feet the whole time. Rollins and McIntyre are both excellent wrestlers, and they put on a match that was worthy of the main event spot. The match lasted 27 minutes and 34 seconds, and had a rating of 7.03 out of 10.

### WWE United States Title Match: Logan Paul vs. Rey Mysterio (93.4)

This match was another exciting affair, and it was a big surprise that Logan Paul was able to defeat the legendary Rey Mysterio to win the United States Title. Paul impressed with his athleticism and in-ring ability, and Mysterio always puts on a great match. The match lasted 23 minutes and 20 seconds, and had a rating of 7 out of 10.

### WWE Title / WWE Universal Title Match: Roman Reigns vs. LA Knight (92.03)

This match was a well-executed, back-and-forth affair that saw two of WWE’s top stars go at it. Roman Reigns is the current champion, and LA Knight is a rising star who is sure to be a major player in the company for years to come. The match lasted 22 minutes and 3 seconds, and had a rating of 6.9 out of 10.

## The Worst Matches to Skip

Based on the MQI, here are the matches you can skip from WWE Crown Jewel 2023:

### WWE Women’s World Title Fatal Five Way Match: Rhea Ripley vs. Nia Jax and Raquel Rodriguez and Shayna Baszler and Zoey Stark (70.05)

This match was a bit chaotic and didn’t give any of the wrestlers enough time to really shine. Rhea Ripley is a great champion, but this match didn’t do her any favors. The match lasted 10 minutes and 5 seconds, and had a rating of 6 out of 10.

### Singles Match: Solo Sikoa vs. John Cena (68.1)

This match was a bit of a disappointment, as it didn’t live up to the hype. Solo Sikoa is a talented wrestler, but he wasn’t able to get much offense in against the legendary John Cena. The match lasted 8 minutes and 10 seconds, and had a rating of 6 out of 10.

### WWE Women’s Title Match: IYO SKY vs. Bianca Belair (67.37)

This match was a bit slow and didn’t have any of the high spots that we’re used to seeing from Bianca Belair. IYO SKY is a solid wrestler, but she wasn’t able to bring out the best in Belair. The match lasted 7 minutes and 37 seconds, and had a rating of 6 out of 10.

WWE Crown Jewel 2023 was a great event that had some amazing matches. However, not all matches were worth your time, and some of them were better off skipped.
