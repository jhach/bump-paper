# Frequently Asked Questions about the Match Quality Index (MQI)

The Match Quality Index (MQI) is a metric that ranks the matches from WWE events based on their quality, using the match rating, the match length, and the WON rating. In this FAQ page, we will answer some of the most common questions about the MQI and how it works.

## What is the match rating?
The match rating is a subjective measure of the quality of the match, based on the ratings from [CAGEMATCH](https://www.cagematch.net/?ref=bumpxfeed.com), a website that provides ratings and match length for wrestling matches. The match rating is based on the votes of the users of the website, who can rate the matches from 0 to 10. The match rating is the average of all the votes for a given match.

## What is the match length?
The match length is the duration of the match in minutes, as reported by [CAGEMATCH](https://www.cagematch.net/?ref=bumpxfeed.com). The match length is an objective measure of the quality of the match, as longer matches are generally more physically demanding and require more endurance from the wrestlers.

## What is the WON rating?
The WON rating is a subjective measure of the quality of the match, based on the ratings from the [Wrestling Observer Newsletter](https://www.f4wonline.com/?ref=bumpxfeed.com), a newsletter that covers professional wrestling and mixed martial arts. The WON rating is based on the opinion of Dave Meltzer, the editor and publisher of the newsletter, who can rate the matches from 0 to 5 stars, with the possibility of adding a plus (+) or a minus (-) sign to indicate a slightly higher or lower rating. The WON rating is considered to be one of the most influential and respected ratings in the wrestling industry.

## How is the MQI calculated?
The MQI is calculated as follows:

```
MQI = (Match Rating * 10) + Match Length + (WON Rating * 10)
```

This formula gives more weight to the match rating and the WON rating, as they are more subjective measures of the quality of the match. However, it also takes into account the length of the match, as longer matches are generally more physically demanding and require more endurance from the wrestlers.

The MQI ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better matches.

## How can I use the MQI to decide which matches to watch and which ones to skip?
The MQI can help you decide which matches to watch and which ones to skip, based on your preferences and time availability. For example, if you want to watch the best matches from a WWE event, you can look for the matches with the highest MQI scores. If you want to watch the most entertaining matches from a WWE event, you can look for the matches with the highest match ratings and WON ratings. If you want to watch the most challenging matches from a WWE event, you can look for the matches with the longest match lengths.

However, the MQI is not a definitive measure of the quality of the match, and it may not reflect your personal taste and opinion. Therefore, you should always use your own judgment and discretion when choosing which matches to watch and which ones to skip.

## Where can I find the MQI scores for the matches from WWE events?
You can find the MQI scores for the matches from WWE events on our blog, where we rank the matches from each event based on the MQI metric, and give you our recommendations on which ones to watch and which ones to skip. You can also find the match ratings, the match lengths, and the WON ratings for each match, as well as the sources and references for the data.

## Is the MQI a perfect metric?

No, the MQI is not a perfect metric. There are some limitations to the metric, such as:

* The subjectivity of match ratings.
* The fact that match length does not always correlate with match quality.
* However, the MQI is a valuable tool that can help fans make more informed decisions about which WWE matches to watch.

## What are some other resources I can use to find good WWE matches to watch?

In addition to using the MQI, you can also use the following resources to find good WWE matches to watch:

* Online reviews and ratings.
* Social media discussions.
* WWE Network and Peacock. 

## Why the Match Quality Index (MQI) is a Reliable Tool for WWE Match Ratings

In today's digital age, where information is readily available at our fingertips, consumers often rely on online reviews and ratings to make informed decisions about their purchases or experiences. Just as Google ratings have become an indispensable tool for evaluating products and services, the Match Quality Index (MQI) can serve as a valuable guide for discerning WWE fans.

Similar to Google ratings, the MQI provides a consistent and objective measure of match quality, allowing fans to make informed choices about which matches to watch and which to skip. By combining the subjective element of match rating with the objective measure of match length, the MQI provides a more comprehensive assessment of a match's overall quality.

Here are some key reasons why the MQI is a reliable tool for WWE match ratings:

* Objectivity: The MQI incorporates an objective measure, match length, which provides a consistent basis for comparison across different matches. This objectivity helps to eliminate biases and ensures that ratings are not solely based on personal preferences or subjective factors.

* Comprehensiveness: The MQI considers both the overall rating of a match and its duration, providing a more holistic assessment of its quality. This comprehensiveness ensures that fans are not misled by matches that receive high ratings but are relatively short or lack substance.

* Consistency: The MQI utilizes a consistent formula, ensuring that ratings are calculated in a uniform manner. This consistency allows fans to compare ratings across different matches and platforms with confidence.

* Relevance: The MQI is specifically designed to evaluate WWE matches, taking into account the unique characteristics and nuances of professional wrestling. This relevance ensures that ratings are tailored to the specific genre and fan base.

* Evolving: The MQI is not a static metric; it can be adapted and refined as the landscape of professional wrestling evolves. This adaptability ensures that the MQI remains relevant and useful as the sport continues to change and develop.

Just as Google ratings have become an invaluable tool for consumers, the Match Quality Index (MQI) can serve as a trusted guide for WWE fans. By utilizing the MQI, fans can confidently navigate the vast array of matches and make informed decisions about which ones to invest their time and energy in.
