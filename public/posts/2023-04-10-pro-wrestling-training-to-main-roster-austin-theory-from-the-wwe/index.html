If you’re a fan of professional wrestling, then you’ve probably heard of Austin Theory. He’s one of the newest and most promising faces in the industry. In this blog post, we’ll take a look at his athletic background, his journey to becoming a WWE superstar, and his rise to becoming the United States Champion.\nAustin Theory’s Athletic Background Before Austin Theory became a professional wrestler, he was involved in bodybuilding. He trained hard and built an impressive physique before he decided to pursue his passion for wrestling. This athletic background helped him to become a formidable wrestler in the ring, with a strength and agility that few others possess.\nAustin Theory’s Journey to the WWE Austin Theory began his wrestling career at a young age and trained at the World Wrestling Alliance 4 (WWA4) wrestling school in Atlanta, Georgia. In 2016, he made his debut in the wrestling promotion Evolve, where he quickly gained attention for his impressive athleticism and charisma. He competed in other prominent wrestling promotions such as Full Impact Pro (FIP), World Wrestling Network, and Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (PWG).\nAfter three years of hard work and dedication, Austin Theory caught the eye of the WWE and signed with them in 2019. He joined the NXT brand (WWE’s developmental territory) and quickly gained recognition for his in-ring skills and confident persona. Theory had notable matches against established NXT stars and was praised for his potential as a future star in WWE.\nAustin Theory’s Main Roster Debut In 2020, Theory was promoted to the main roster for WWE’s RAW in March where he tagged with Angel Garza \u0026 Seth Rollins, but lost to Kevin Owens \u0026 The Street Profits. He would remain on RAW until June 2020 when WWE sent him back to NXT for additional training.\nAustin Theory’s Rise to the Top In 2021, Austin Theory became a member of the wrestling stable “The Way” on WWE’s weekly television show, NXT. He was also appearing on Smackdown dark matches to gain more experience in front of an audience.\nHe started wrestling full time with RAW in October 2021 and occasionally Smackdown. In 2022, Austin Theory captured the United States Championship by defeating Bobby Lashley and Seth Rollins at Survivor Series, and as of this writing, he is still the reigning WWE US Champion.\nAustin Theory’s Wrestlemania Moment In 2023, Austin Theory faced his childhood hero, John Cena, at Wrestlemania 39 at Sofi Stadium in Los Angeles, California. He pinned John Cena in the opening match of Night 1 and retained his United States title, cementing his status as a top-tier wrestler in the WWE.\nIn conclusion, Austin Theory’s journey from bodybuilder to professional wrestler has been an inspiring one. His hard work and dedication have paid off, and he is now a top-tier wrestler in the WWE. As he continues to hone his craft, we can’t wait to see what he has in store for us in the future.\n","wordCount":"494","inLanguage":"en","image":"http://localhost:1313/austin_theory_us_title.webp","datePublished":"2023-04-10T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2023-11-19T12:22:49+11:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jalen Wu"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/2023-04-10-pro-wrestling-training-to-main-roster-austin-theory-from-the-wwe/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"bumpXfeed","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://bumpxfeed.com/images/bfblack32.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="bumpXfeed (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/images/bfblack180.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>bumpXfeed</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/ title=posts><span>posts</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/categories/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Pro Wrestling Training to Main Roster: Austin Theory from the WWE</h1><div class=post-description>Austin Theory defeated his childhood hero, WWE legend John Cena, by pinfall at Wrestlemania 39 in Los Angeles, California.
