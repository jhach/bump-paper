It arrived just before the global pandemic and subsequent budget cuts significantly impacted the company’s recruitment. This group, consisting of five seasoned independent wrestlers and a standout basketball player with professional experience, marked a distinct moment in WWE’s talent acquisition strategy.\nThis article delves into the careers of these individual trainees, exploring their trajectories since joining the WWE and their current status within the wrestling industry. Did they stay the course, or did their paths take unexpected turns? Read on to discover their journeys.\n🌮 Alex Zayne High-flying innovator Alex Zayne has carved a unique path in the world of professional wrestling. His journey began in 2005, leading him to various independent promotions worldwide. Zayne’s technical prowess and captivating in-ring performances earned him a reputation as a top contender, eventually catching the eye of prestigious Japanese promotion New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW).\nZayne’s impressive NJPW run led to a coveted opportunity with WWE in 2020. He signed with their developmental brand, NXT, under the ring name “Ari Sterling.” While his time with WWE showcased his potential, budget cuts related to the pandemic resulted in his release in 2021.\nReflecting on his NXT experience with Wrestling Inc., Zayne remained positive. He praised the locker room, producers, and writers, highlighting the experience as an invaluable learning opportunity. He humorously referred to it as “being paid to go to wrestling Harvard for ten months.”\n“Every thing is good. That’s why the name thing is frustrating for me because they’re on top of their s*** for the most part. Every place and person and thing in the world has its faults, but overall the whole experience was incredibly positive. The locker room was incredible. The producers were awesome. The writers were cool. Everyone was super cool and just trying their best to do whatever they think is best, right? So, the most positive thing for me, on a personal level, would be just that I basically got paid to go to the wrestling Harvard for ten months. That’s awesome. Who can argue with that?”\nWrestling Inc\nUndeterred by the WWE departure, Zayne returned to his independent roots, thriving in NJPW Strong and other promotions. He continues to captivate audiences with his signature moves, including the “Cinnamon Twist” and the “Taco Driver.” Notably, Zayne has secured an international brand deal with Taco Bell in Japan, featuring the “Alex Zayne Meal.” Now that I can add some context to this vague tweet…\nI’m gettin my own Alex Zayne Meal at Taco Bell in Japan. 🌮🔔🇯🇵 Making me an unsigned, independent, professional wrestler with an international brand deal.\nFor those in the same line of work, the opportunities are out… https://t.co/ZlhQsETYvJ pic.twitter.com/1ZgxJxT8Xw\n— Alex Zayne - アレックス・ゼイン (@AlexZayneSauce) November 17, 2023 Status: Active (NJPW, GCW, Independents, Taco Bell)\nRuss Taylor California native Russell Taylor, also known as Tyler Rust, boasts a career spanning over 16 years, starting at the Empire Wrestling Federation (EWF) at a young age of 16.
