This is an important factor to consider, especially if you’re going to be training at night or on weekends. Cost: Pro wrestling schools can range in price from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars. It’s important to set a budget before you start shopping around. Trainers: Who are the trainers at the school? Are they experienced professionals who can teach you the right way to wrestle? Curriculum: What does the school’s curriculum cover? Does it include everything you need to know to become a successful pro wrestler? Facilities: Does the school have adequate training facilities? This includes a ring, mats, and other necessary equipment. Questions to ask when visiting a pro wrestling school Once you’ve narrowed down your choices, it’s time to start visiting schools. When you visit a school, be sure to ask the following questions:\nWhat is your teaching philosophy? What is your experience in the wrestling business? What is your success rate? How many of your students have gone on to become successful professional wrestlers? What is your curriculum like? What will I learn in your school? What are your safety standards? Can I meet your current students and ask them about their experience? Tips for choosing the right pro wrestling school Here are a few additional tips for choosing the right pro wrestling school:\nDo your research: Read online reviews and talk to other wrestlers to get their recommendations.\nVisit multiple schools: Don’t just sign up for the first school you visit. Take some time to visit multiple schools and compare them before making a decision.\nListen to your gut: Sometimes, the best way to choose a school is to simply listen to your gut. If you feel good about a school and the trainers, then it’s probably a good fit for you.\nAdditional tips Look for a school that is affiliated with a major wrestling promotion. This will give you a better chance of getting noticed by promoters and scouts. Make sure the school has a good track record of producing successful wrestlers. Look for schools that have trained current and former WWE, AEW, and IMPACT wrestlers. Consider the school’s teaching style.
