The Match Quality Index (MQI) is a metric that combines match rating and match length to provide a comprehensive assessment of the quality of a professional wrestling match. It is designed to help fans make informed decisions about which matches to watch and which to skip.\nHow is the MQI calculated? The MQI is calculated using the following formula:\nMQI = (Match Rating * 10) + Match Length For example, a match that receives an average rating of 7.5 and lasts for 15 minutes would have an MQI of 90.\nWhat are the benefits of using the MQI? There are several benefits to using the MQI, including:\nObjectivity: The MQI incorporates an objective measure, match length, which provides a consistent basis for comparison across different matches. Comprehensiveness: The MQI considers both the overall rating of a match and its duration, providing a more holistic assessment of its quality. Consistency: The MQI utilizes a consistent formula, ensuring that ratings are calculated in a uniform manner. Relevance: The MQI is specifically designed to evaluate WWE matches, taking into account the unique characteristics and nuances of professional wrestling.

By combining the subjective element of match rating with the objective measure of match length, the MQI provides a more comprehensive assessment of a match’s overall quality.\nHere are some key reasons why the MQI is a reliable tool for WWE match ratings:\nObjectivity: The MQI incorporates an objective measure, match length, which provides a consistent basis for comparison across different matches. This objectivity helps to eliminate biases and ensures that ratings are not solely based on personal preferences or subjective factors.\nComprehensiveness: The MQI considers both the overall rating of a match and its duration, providing a more holistic assessment of its quality.
