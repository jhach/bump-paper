watch guide","WWE"],"articleBody":"Frequently Asked Questions about the Match Quality Index (MQI)\nWhat is the MQI? The Match Quality Index (MQI) is a data-driven metric that evaluates the quality of professional wrestling matches. It takes into account three key factors: match rating and match duration as reported by CAGEMATCH, and WON rating.\nThe WON rating is a subjective measure of the quality of the match, based on the ratings from the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, a newsletter that covers professional wrestling and mixed martial arts. The WON rating is based on the opinion of Dave Meltzer, the editor and publisher of the newsletter, who can rate the matches from 0 to 5 stars, with the possibility of adding a plus (+) or a minus (-) sign to indicate a slightly higher or lower rating. The WON rating is considered to be one of the most influential and respected ratings in the wrestling industry.\nHow is the MQI calculated? The MQI is calculated using the following formula:\nMQI = (0.4 * Match Rating) + (0.2 * Match Duration) + (0.4 * WON Rating) Where:\nMatch Rating: The average rating given to the match by fans on a scale of 1 to 10. Match Duration: The total length of the match in minutes. The minutes are rounded according to standard rules (ex: 18:50 will round up to 19 minutes). WON Rating: The rating given to the match by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter, on a scale of 0 to 5 stars. What do the MQI scores mean? MQI scores can be interpreted as follows:\n9 or above: Exceptional match 8 to 8.9: Very good match 7 to 7.9: Good match 6 to 6.9: Average match 5 or below: Below average match What are the benefits of using the MQI? The MQI provides several benefits, including:\nA more objective way to evaluate match quality: The MQI is based on data rather than subjective opinions. A way to identify the best matches to watch: Fans can use the MQI to prioritize matches that are likely to be memorable and enjoyable. A way to track the quality of professional wrestling over time: The MQI can be used to track trends in match quality and identify how different factors, such as promotion, wrestlers, and booking, affect match quality. Where can I find MQI scores? You can find the MQI scores for the matches from WWE, AEW, Impact, ROH, and more events on our blog, where we rank the matches from each event based on the MQI metric, and give you our recommendations on which ones to watch and which ones to skip. You can also find the match ratings, the match lengths, and the WON ratings for each match, as well as the sources and references for the data.\nHow can I use the MQI to make informed viewing choices? When choosing which matches to watch, fans can consider the following factors:\nMQI score: A higher MQI score generally indicates a better match. Match type: Some fans prefer certain types of matches, such as singles matches or tag team matches. Wrestlers: Some fans prefer to watch matches featuring their favorite wrestlers. Is the MQI a perfect metric? No, the MQI is not a perfect metric. There are some limitations to the metric, such as:\nThe subjectivity of match ratings. The fact that match length does not always correlate with match quality. However, the MQI is a valuable tool that can help fans make more informed decisions about which WWE matches to watch. What are some other resources I can use to find good WWE matches to watch? In addition to using the MQI, you can also use the following resources to find good WWE matches to watch:\nOnline reviews and ratings. Social media discussions. WWE Network and Peacock. Why the Match Quality Index (MQI) is a Reliable Tool for WWE Match Ratings In todayâ€™s digital age, where information is readily available at our fingertips, consumers often rely on online reviews and ratings to make informed decisions about their purchases or experiences. Just as Google ratings have become an indispensable tool for evaluating products and services, the Match Quality Index (MQI) can serve as a valuable guide for discerning WWE fans.\nSimilar to Google ratings, the MQI provides a consistent and objective measure of match quality, allowing fans to make informed choices about which matches to watch and which to skip. By combining the subjective element of match rating with the objective measure of match length, the MQI provides a more comprehensive assessment of a matchâ€™s overall quality.\nHere are some key reasons why the MQI is a reliable tool for WWE match ratings:\nObjectivity: The MQI incorporates an objective measure, match length, which provides a consistent basis for comparison across different matches. This objectivity helps to eliminate biases and ensures that ratings are not solely based on personal preferences or subjective factors.\nComprehensiveness: The MQI considers both the overall rating of a match and its duration, providing a more holistic assessment of its quality. This comprehensiveness ensures that fans are not misled by matches that receive high ratings but are relatively short or lack substance.\nConsistency: The MQI utilizes a consistent formula, ensuring that ratings are calculated in a uniform manner. This consistency allows fans to compare ratings across different matches and platforms with confidence.\nRelevance: The MQI is specifically designed to evaluate WWE matches, taking into account the unique characteristics and nuances of professional wrestling. This relevance ensures that ratings are tailored to the specific genre and fan base.\nEvolving: The MQI is not a static metric; it can be adapted and refined as the landscape of professional wrestling evolves. This adaptability ensures that the MQI remains relevant and useful as the sport continues to change and develop.\nJust as Google ratings have become an invaluable tool for consumers, the Match Quality Index (MQI) can serve as a trusted guide for WWE fans. By utilizing the MQI, fans can confidently navigate the vast array of matches and make informed decisions about which ones to invest their time and energy in.\nI hope this FAQ has been helpful.
